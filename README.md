Haxe Language Bindings for Angular 2
===

I plan to expand this readme in the future, but below are a few pieces of info to let you know where I am currently at with the project:

*Currently working with version: alpha.28
*Heavily work-in-progress, API is subject to change as the Angular 2 API goes through development.
*View 'bin/index.html' (with a webserver) to see the current examples which work with these language bindings.
*The Haxe components required are in the 'angular2haxe' and 'browser' folders.
*If you want to see the Haxe code which creates Angular 2 components, view 'Main.hx' and the code in the 'test' folder.
